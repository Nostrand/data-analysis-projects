was the Moon, as evidenced by the highest exploration expenditure. However, once the space race ended in the late 1960s, attention shifted towards Mars, marking a significant transition.\n\nFollowing 1975, there was a period of mixed interest in the Outer Planets and Venus, with subsequent shifts towards a combination of Outer Planets and Mars starting in the early 90s. . This period reflected a diverse range of exploratory efforts, indicating a continued fascination with both the outer regions of our solar system and the neighboring planets Venus and Mars.\n\nInterestingly, at the dawn of the 2000s, there was a resurgence in interest for Mars, accompanied by notable expenditures. Concurrently, exploration efforts targeting Small Bodies and Outer Planets gained momentum but remained relatively secondary to the Mars missions.\n\nOverall, the plot illustrates the dynamic nature of space exploration, highlighting the changing priorities and shifts in investment across different celestial bodies throughout history.","metadata":{},"id":"9e8f5fcf-7645-4586-8322-fe3cd2221e06","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Keep going!","metadata":{},"id":"fc0d3017-7cc2-4531-8ab3-c601dfd05f6b","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"If you want to continue analyzing the data, here are some questions you can answer.
